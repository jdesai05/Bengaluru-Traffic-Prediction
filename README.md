# Bengaluru Traffic Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict traffic conditions in Bengaluru using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains traffic volume data across different areas and intersections, which is analyzed and visualized to build a predictive model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations (heatmaps, graphs, etc.)
- Machine learning model to predict future traffic patterns
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Banglore_traffic_Dataset.csv`, which contains:
- **Area Name**: Name of the location
- **Road/Intersection Name**: Specific road or intersection
- **Traffic Volume**: Traffic count at the given location and time
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of recorded traffic data

## Installation
To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bengaluru-Traffic-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Bengaluru-Traffic-Prediction
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook and perform traffic analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook TrafficPrediction.ipynb
```

### Key Steps in the Notebook:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Visualize traffic trends with heatmaps and time series graphs
4. Train machine learning models for traffic prediction
5. Evaluate model performance using error metrics

## Results
- **Heatmap visualization** of traffic volume across different intersections
- **Time-series analysis** of traffic congestion trends
- **Machine learning predictions** for future traffic volume
- **Model performance evaluation** using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores
